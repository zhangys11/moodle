issueNumber: MDL-83432
notes:
  core_enrol:
    - message: >-
        The `after_user_enrolled` hook now contains a `roleid` property to allow
        for listeners to determine which role was assigned during user enrolment
        (if any)


        The base enrolment `enrol_plugin::send_course_welcome_message_to_user`
        method also now accepts a `$roleid` parameter in order to correctly
        populate the `courserole` placeholder
      type: changed
